## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

My main challenge is that I do not have a phone number so that I cannot register for imgur account to upload my gif. Then I tried to use gifyu.com instead :-) However. the Codepath website does NOT accept link from gifyu, so I have to ask my friend to receive code from imgur so that I could register my imgur account.
